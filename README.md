# Python Scikit-learn Algorithms

This project contains implementations and experiments using **scikit-learn** machine learning algorithms.  
It also includes essential **data preprocessing** and basic **data science workflows** for preparing and analyzing datasets.

## Current Scope

- Focused on **supervised learning**, primarily:
  - **Classification** algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, k-NN, Random Forest, SVM)
- Includes basic **evaluation metrics** such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation
- Additionaly i started **unsupervised learning**

## Technologies

- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib
